Game of 2013.2.24
=======================

On Feb. 22th, 2 days before the Lantern Festival in China, I created this respository in memory of something.

Actually, I don't know what this game means but I do find it like a Song Poems, 

> When all at once I turn my head,find her there lantern light is dimly shed. 

The idea of the game is originated from this poem.
